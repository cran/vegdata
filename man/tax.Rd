\arguments{
\item{x}{Species number, lettercode or species name(s)}

\item{refl}{Taxonomic reference list}

\item{detailed}{In old Turboveg versions detailed taxonomic information could only be given in an extra file which was called tax.dbf in GermanSL. Compatibility mode.}

\item{concept}{Name of the file with an alternative taxon view stored in the reference list directory, see details.}

\item{strict}{Exact match or partial matching with \code{\link{grep}}}

\item{simplify}{Should taxname.simplify be applied to find species}

\item{quiet}{Hide screen messages}

\item{\dots}{additional attributes for taxname.abbr or taxname.simplify}

\description{
Input is either species number (integer), shortletter (7 characters) or full (exact!) species name.
}
\details{
\dfn{concept}: GermanSL is a list with a single taxon view according to the standard lists of the different taxon groups (e.g Wisskirchen and Haeupler for higher plants, see).
Nevertheless a huge number of synonyms is included which allows in many cases the transformation into different concepts.
For illustration the concept of \emph{Armeria maritima} from Korneck 1996 is included, which accepts e.g. \emph{Armeria maritima ssp. bottendorfensis}.
\dfn{parse.taxa}: parse genus and epitheta from name strings.
\dfn{taxname.removeAuthors} Remove name authors from full scientific name strings.
