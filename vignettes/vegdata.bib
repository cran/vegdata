	provides methods for input. import, selection, and export of releves.
	In 1994, TURBOVEG was accepted as the standard computer package for
	the European Vegetation Survey. Currently it has been installed in
	more than 25 countries throughout Europe and overseas.},

@article{Dengleretal2011,
abstract = {Questions: How many vegetation-plot records (relev\'{e}s) are available in electronic databases, how are they distributed in terms of geography, what are their properties and how might they discovered and obtained for use in subsequent studies? Location: Global. Methods: We compiled the Global Index of Vegetation-Plot Databases (GIVD; http://www.givd.info), an internet-based resource aimed at registration of metadata on existing vegetation databases. For inclusion, databases need to (i) contain temporally and spatially explicit species co-occurrence data and (ii) be accessible to the scientific public. This paper summarizes the structure and data quality of the databases registered in GIVD as by 22 September 2010. Results: On the given date, 108 databases containing more than 2.3 million independent plots had been registered in GIVD. The majority of these data are contained in European databases (71 databases, 1.5 million plots), whereas other continents are represented by substantially smaller numbers (North America 13 databases, South America 6, Africa 8, Asia 8, Oceania 2, multi- continental 1). The oldest plot record dates from 1864, but the vast majority of the plots have been collected since 1970. Most of the plots report vegetation on an area of 1–1000 m². Some databases also store time series and nested-plot data. Apart from the geographic reference (required for inclusion), information was provided for the listed plots frequently on altitude (44\%), slope and inclination (35\%), and land use (26\%), but rarely on soil properties (all less than 7\%). Conclusions: The vegetation-plot data registered in GIVD constitute a major resource for biodiversity informatics, both through the large number of species occurrence records and, unlike most other datasets, the storage of species co-occurrence information at a small scale, combined with structural data and plot-based environmental data. We identify some short comings in available data that still need to be addressed (sampling underrepresented geographic regions, providing better incentives for data collection and sharing, developing user-friendly exchange standards between databases, as well as tools to analyse and remove confounding effects of sampling biases). However, the increased ease of discoverability and availability of such datasets conferred by registration in GIVD offers significant opportunities for large-scale studies in areas such as community assembly, macroecology, and global-change research.
