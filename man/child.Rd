\details{
\dfn{concept}: GermanSL is a list with a single taxon view according to the standard lists of the different taxon groups (e.g Wisskirchen and Haeupler for higher plants, see).
  Nevertheless a huge number of synonyms is included which allows in many cases the transformation into different concepts.
  For illustration the concept of \emph{Armeria maritima} from Korneck 1996 is included, which accepts e.g. \emph{Armeria maritima ssp. bottendorfensis}.
  \dfn{parse.taxa}: parse genus and epitheta from name strings.
  \dfn{taxname.removeAuthors} Remove name authors from full scientific name strings.
