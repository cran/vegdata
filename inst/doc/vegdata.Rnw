\section{Preliminary notes}
    Some \texttt{vegdata} functions expect an installation, or more precisely the main directory structure, of the vegetation database program Turboveg for Windows (see \url{'http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg/'} and \cite{Hennekens2001}. If the package can not find a Turboveg installation it will use the directory within the package installation path. If you want to use function \texttt{taxval} for taxonomic harmonization you will need to have GermanSL or an equally structured reference list. If you do not specify any, the most recent version of GermanSL will be used and if it can not be found within the specified path, it will be downloaded from \url{http://geobot.botanik.uni-greifswald.de/reflist}.

    Turboveg uses dBase database format for storage. The package tries to deal with the limitations of that format but it is essential, that you use "Database -> Reindex" in Turboveg every time you delete something in your Turboveg database. Otherwise it will not be deleted immediately in the dBase file, instead it is only marked for deletion, i.e. it is still there when you access this file with R and will not be recognized as deleted until you reindex your Turboveg database.

\section{Provided functionality}
  \subsection{Database access}
    At the moment vegdata provides direct access to two different vegetation database formats:
\begin{description}
 \item[Turboveg] is a desktop program, written in VisualBasic. It provides basic functions to enter, import, maintain and export vegetation data. From the 2 000 000 vegetation plot registered in \url{http://www.GIVD.info} approximately 1.5 million are stored in Turboveg databases format.
\item[VegetWeb] is the German national vegetation database. VegetWeb is developed as a MySQL-Server database at the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN) and can used via a PHP framework at \url{http://www.floraweb.de/vegetation/vegetweb/RechercheView.php}.
 \end{description}

 \subsection{Taxonomic harmonisation}
    One of the most important steps in using vegetation data (from different sources) for statistical analysis is to take care about the taxonomic content of the names existing in the database. That is, to make sure, that exactly one (correct and valid) name defines one biological entity. Most researchers remember to convert synonyms to valid names but in many cases the care about e.g. monotypic subspecies or ambiguous taxonomic levels is lacking \citep{Jansen2010}.
    The package offers the function \texttt{taxval} with different options for the adjustment of synonyms, monotypic taxa, taxonomic levels, members of aggregates and undetermined species.

  \subsection{Cover standardization}
    Turboveg provides different abundance codes and all kinds of user defined cover codes can easily be added. For vegetation analysis a unique species performance platform is needed which will in most cases be the percentage cover of the observed plot area. Therefore, for every abundance code class the mean cover percentage is defined in Turboveg.
    Since different scales can occur in a database and the storage format of the code table in Turboveg is somewhat strange, the function \texttt{tv.coverperc} provides automatic conversion for convenience.

  \subsection{Layer aggregation}
    The most frequently used sample unit in vegetation science is a plot based vegetation relev\'{e} \citep{Dengleretal2011}. A Braun-Blanquet relev\'{e} is a sample of names and coverage (abundance) of species in a specified area (usually between 1 and 1000 $m^2$) at a specific time. It contains (at least is intended to contain) a \emph{complete} list of photo-autotrophic plants (or a defined subset) in that plot.
    This information can be stored in a three-column list of relev\'{e} ID, Taxon ID and performance measure (e.g. cover code).

    Often additional information about the kind of occurrence is wanted. In Turboveg one additional column for the most widespread attribute is included by default: growth height classes. E.g. in a forest it is of interest, if a woody species reaches full height (tree layer) or occurs only as a small individual (herb layer).
    Other attributes like micro location (hummock or depression, rock or dead wood), development stage (juvenile or not, flowering status etc.) or the month of survey in a multi-seasonal survey could also be of interest and can be added in Turboveg.
    For analysis you may want to differentiate species with different species-plot attributes (e.g. growing in different layers). Function \texttt{tv.veg} provides possibilities for species-plot attribute handling.

  \subsection{Vegetation matrix}
    Turboveg stores relev\'{e}s as a dataframe of occurrences (s. below) but almost all functions and programs for vegetation analyses use plot-species cross-tables with a 0 value for non-occurrence = observed absence.
    Function \texttt{tv.veg} inflates the Turboveg list to matrix format with plots in rows and species in columns. Column names can be either species numbers, species letter-codes (default) or full names (with underscores instead of blanks to match the R naming conevntions).

\section{Preparations}

The best way to introduce the functionalities of the package is a session with example code.

We load the library as usual into our R environment.
<<load, results=hide>>=
library(vegdata)
@

Many functions use the directory structure of Turboveg. The first time such a function is called, the internal function \texttt{tv.home} tries to find your Turboveg installation path. Depending on whether you have Turboveg installed on your computer or not, it will give you a message about the Turboveg installation path or the path to the Turboveg directory structure of package vegdata.
<<eval=TRUE>>=
tv.home()
@

If you want to change this, declare manually by setting option "tv\_home":
<<eval=FALSE>>=
options(tv_home="path_to_your_Turboveg_root_directory")
@

<<echo=FALSE>>=
options(tv_home=file.path(.path.package("vegdata"), 'tvdata'))
@


\section{Service functions}
<<dblisting>>=
tv.db()
@
will give you a list of possible database names (directories within the Turboveg Data directory).

<<>>=
tv.refl()
@
GermanSL is the default Taxonomic reference list in package \texttt{vegdata}.
However, whenever you use a Turboveg database name in a function, the Reference list will be read from the database configuration file "tvwin.set" if possible.

Package vegdata contains several service functions to query the taxonomic information contained in the reference list.
<<tax>>=
tax('Achillea millefolium')
@

"GermanSL 1.2" is not included in vegdata to keep the R package small. Instead the reference list will be automatically downloaded into the tv\_home directory (see \texttt{tv.home()}), if it is not installed but needed. If you want to use a different list, specify \texttt{refl=<Name of your list>} according to the directory name in the Turboveg directory \emph{Species}.
Function \texttt{tax} will use the given character string, or 7 letter abbreviation or TaxonUsageID (called SPECIES\_NR in Turboveg) to look for all (partially) matching species names within the reference list
<<>>=
tax('Achillea millefolium', strict=TRUE, verbose=TRUE) 
@
Additional to the Turboveg standard fields comprehensive information for every taxon is stored in an extra file (tax.dbf) which can be used with option \textit{verbose=TRUE}. \\
\textit{tax} will give you all matching names by default. If you set option \textit{strict=TRUE}, only the species with exact match to the given character string will be returned. \\
\textit{syn} will give you all taxon names within the swarm of synonyms. The valid name is markes in colum SYNONYM with FALSE.

<<syn>>=
tax('Elytrigia repens')$TaxonName
syn('Elytrigia repens')
@

The reference list contains information about the taxonomic hierarchy which can be used with \textit{childs} or \textit{parents}.
<<childs>>=
childs(27, quiet=TRUE)$TaxonName
parents('ACHIMIL')
@
If you want to learn more about the taxonomic reference list \emph{GermanSL} for Germany, please look at \cite{Jansen2008}. You can download the list manually from \url{'http://geobot.botanik.uni-greifswald.de/portal/reflist'}.



\section{Taxonomic harmonisation}

Care about the taxonomic content of the datasets is crucial for every analysis. Some of these steps can be automated with an appropriate taxonomic reference. For background and details see \citep{Jansen2010}.


<<db>>=
db <- 'taxatest'
@
Defines the vegetation database name according to the name of the Turboveg database directory name

<<meta, eval=FALSE>>=
tv.metainfo(db)
@
Metainformation, i.e. information about the kind of available information should always be given for every database. Since Turboveg does not ask and provide such information, write a simple text file called metainfo.txt and save it within the database folder.
Turboveg does not provide any metadata handling. \\
Database \texttt{taxatest} is an artificial dataset to show functionalities and necessary steps for taxonomic harmonization.

Let's have a look at the Turboveg data structure.
<<obs>>=
obs.tax <- tv.obs(db)
# Adding species names
species <- tax('all')
obs.tax$TaxonName <-  species$TaxonName[match(obs.tax$TaxonUsageID, species$TaxonUsageID)]
head(obs.tax[,c('RELEVE_NR','TaxonUsageID','COVER_CODE','LAYER','TaxonName')])
@

This condensed format shows only presences of species observations. Every species observation is stored in one row and the membership to a specific vegetation plot is given in column \textit{RELEVE\_NR}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Function taxval}

We are using the taxonomic reference list GermanSL \citep{Jansen2008} which contains not only information about synonymy of species names, but also about the taxonomic hierarchy. This enables several semi-automatic enhancements of the taxonomic information stored in your vegetation database. If your database is not referenced to GermanSL (and can not be converted), you have to dismiss function \texttt{taxval} (option tax=FALSE in \texttt{tv.veg}) and do the taxonomic harmonization by hand (function \texttt{comb.species}).

<<taxval, eval=TRUE>>=
obs.taxval <- taxval(obs.tax, db=db, mono='lower')
@

The database contains 25 different names in the beginning.
\paragraph{Synonyms} 5 of the species names are synonyms and are therefore transferred to legal taxon names, respectively numbers (see option syn='adapt'). If you want to preserve synonyms, choose option syn='conflict' or 'preserve'.

\paragraph{Monotypic species within the area}
Monotypic taxa are valid taxa which are the only child of their next higher taxonomic rank within the survey area. By default they will be converted by \texttt{taxval} to the higher rank. For instance \emph{Poa trivialis} is in Germany only represented by \emph{Poa trivialis subspecies trivialis}. Both taxa are valid, but for most analysis only one name for these identical entities must be used. By default a list of monotypic taxa within the GermanSL (whole Germany) is considered (see \texttt{tv.mono('GermanSL 1.2')}). The default is to set all monotypic species to the higher rank (because many monotypic subspecies can occur in vegetation databases). \\
If necessary, the procedure has to be repeated through the taxonomic 

\paragraph{Trimming the hierarchy}
If your database contains the taxon \textit{Asteraceae spec.}, the taxval code explained in the next chapter will aggregate occurrences of all your \textit{Asteracea} to the family level. To prevent this you can delete all observations above a certain taxonomic level. The default is not to trim the hierarchy (ROOT = "Greenish something" is the toplevel).

\paragraph{Solving the nestedness}
If your database contains \textit{Achillea millefolium} but also \textit{Achillea millefolium agg.} for most analysis it will be necessary to coarsen the first (option ag='conflict') because \textit{A. millefolium agg.} will probably include further occurrences of \textit{Achillea millefolium}. \\
The procedure has to be repeated until all occurring taxonomical levels are considered. \\
Especially with aggregates and their members the coarsening to the higher level can be a sad fate. If you have 100 occurrences of \textit{Achillea millefolium} but a single one with \textit{A. mill. agg.} you might want to clean your observational dataframe beforehand or do the aggregation afterwards manually with tv.veg(db, ag='preserve') and a manual correction with function comb.species (see below).

I confess that it is a strange and complete artificial example. Starting with 25 names in the beginning only 13 taxa survived the valuation. All others had to be converted.
<<Taxon>>=
obs.taxval$TaxonName <-  species$TaxonName[match(obs.taxval$TaxonUsageID, species$TaxonUsageID)]
obs.taxval[,c('RELEVE_NR', 'COVER_CODE', 'TaxonName')]
@

\paragraph{Critical Pseudonyms}
Taxon misapplication is maybe the greatest danger in using survey data. Known misapplications of names (.auct) are embedded within GermanSL. Please pay attention, if these might also be relevant for your dataset. \\
Completely independent from the questions of correct taxonomic naming of a specific specimen, the boundary of a taxon interpretation can differ much \citet[see][]{Jansen2010}. This should be adequately solved during data entry. Nevertheless these warnings gives you a last chance to rethink the correctness of your taxon assignments.

\paragraph{Coarsening to a specific taxonomic level}

If you want only taxa of e.g. level "species" in your analyses but no other taxonomic level, use \texttt{taxval(obs, ag='adapt', rank='SPE')}. All hierarchical levels below the species level (including the above specified monotypic subspecies) are set to species level in this case.

<<coarsen, eval=TRUE, results=hide>>=
tmp <- taxval(obs.tax, refl='GermanSL 1.2', ag='adapt', rank='FAM')
tmp$oldTaxon <- tax(obs.tax$TaxonUsageID, refl='GermanSL 1.2')$TaxonName
tmp$newTaxon <- tax(tmp$TaxonUsageID, refl='GermanSL 1.2')$TaxonName
@
<<print.coarsen>>=
head(tmp[,c('oldTaxon','newTaxon')], 10)
@

Check \texttt{?taxval} and \texttt{args(taxval)} for more options.


\subsection{Implementing other taxon views}

If you wish to use another taxonomic concept (see \cite{Berendsohn1995}) than the default, you can use a conversion table to change synonymy etc. to catch your needs. 
<<taxonviews, eval=FALSE>>=
newconcept <- taxval(obs, db=db, concept='korneck1996')
@


\section{Vegetation matrices}

At the moment there exists no formal class for vegetation data in R. But most functions in \texttt{vegan}, \texttt{ade4} or other packages expect vegetation data to be stored in a matrix with species in columns and plots in rows. Therefore, we need to inflate the Turboveg format (where zero occurrences are missing) to such a matrix.

\texttt{tv.veg} is a wrapper for the above mentioned functions and produces a vegetation matrix with releves as rows and species as columns.
Additionally care about species-plot attribute differentiation and combination, and the handling of species codes is provided.

\subsection{Performance measures}

At least in Europe most vegetation plots have information about the performance of a species within the survey area, often given in some kind of alphanumeric code for cover percentage within the survey plot. Different code systems are combined by using the mean cover percentage per cover code class. Function \texttt{tv.coverperc} will do this job according to the definitions in \emph{Turboveg/Popup/tvscale.dbf} and the entries in the header data column \texttt{COVERSCALE}.

<<coverperc>>=
obs <- tv.obs(db)
obs <- tv.coverperc(db, obs)
head(obs)
@

A few simple possibilities for percentage cover transformations are directly included in the \texttt{tv.veg} code, e.g. to use only presence-absence information you can choose option \texttt{cover.transform = 'pa'}.


\subsection{Pseudospecies}
How to account for different vegetation layers or other kinds of species differentiation?

The next step is the separation of pseudo-species. "Pseudo-species" are all kind of taxa split according to species-plot information beyond the performance measure which will be used within the matrix. At this point you have to decide which information should be preserved and which should be aggregated. For instance layer separation must be defined at this step. The default is to differentiate tree, shrub and herb layers but to combine finer layer specifications within them. \\
If we have more than one occurrence of the same species in a plot, e.g. because tree species growing as young stands and adult specimens were differentiated according to growth height classes, we have to create either pseudo-species which differentiate the occurrences in the resulting vegetation matrix or to combine species occurrences from different layers. For the latter we can use different calculations e.g. to sum up all cover percentages of different layers \texttt{lc='sum'} or the maximum value (\texttt{lc='max'}), mean value (\texttt{lc='mean'}). If we assume an independent occurrence of a species in different vertical layers, we can do the calculations with option lc = 'layer' (the default). This results in a probability sum: A species covering 50\% in tree layer 1 and 50\% in herb layer will get a combined cover of 75\% because both layers will overlap 50\% (1 - 0.5*0.5).\\

If you want to specify pseudo-species by other species-plot differentiation you can define a combination dataframe. Two example dataframes are included in the package (\texttt{lc.0} and \texttt{lc.1}). Option comb has to be given as a list with first element naming the column name holding the grouping variable and as second element the name of the combination dataframe. Try \\
<<pseudo1, eval=FALSE>>=
data(lc.0)
tv.veg(db, pseudo = list(lc.0, c("LAYER")), lc = "layer")
@
and check the column names:
<<lc0, echo=FALSE>>=
data(lc.0)
tmp <- tv.veg(db, tax=FALSE, pseudo = list(lc.0, "LAYER"), lc = "layer", quiet=TRUE)
names(tmp)
@

Separated by dots and layer numbers you can see the preserved layers. For meaning of layer numbers see Turboveg help.\\
Check \texttt{(data(lc.1))} for the default layer combination.

Beside layers you can use any kind of species-plot attributes to distinguish between occurrences, for instance in a multi-temporal survey. 

<<Season>>=
comb <- list(data.frame(SEASON=0:4, COMB=c(0,'Spring','Summer','Autumn','Winter')),'SEASON')
names(tv.veg(db, tax=FALSE, pseudo=comb, quiet=TRUE))
@

<<layer, results=hide>>=
data(lc.1)
veg <- tv.veg(db, lc = "sum", pseudo = list(lc.1, 'LAYER'), dec = 1, quiet=TRUE)
@
<<layerdiff>>=
veg[,1:10]
@


\subsection{Combine species manually}

Beside semi-automatic taxon harmonization with function \texttt{taxval} there are two possibilities to change Taxonomy manually. If you decide to interpret a certain species name in your database different than stored in the standard view of the taxonomic reference you can replace species numbers within the observational dataframe and run \texttt{taxval} later on.
<<>>=
obs.tax$TaxonUsageID[obs.tax$TaxonUsageID == 27] <- 31
@
will replace all occurrences of \emph{Achillea millefolium agg.} with \emph{Achillea millefolium} which might be adequate for your survey and will prevent a too coarse taxon grouping. For a longer list of replacements you can use a dataframe.
<<replace>>=
taxon.repl <- data.frame(old=c(27), new=c(31))
obs.tax$TaxonUsageID <- replace(obs.tax$TaxonUsageID, match(taxon.repl$old, obs.tax$TaxonUsageID), taxon.repl$new)
@

The second possibility is to use function \texttt{comb.species} on vegetation matrices.
<<comb.spec, eval=TRUE>>=
veg <- tv.veg('taxatest', quiet=TRUE)
comb.species(veg, sel=c('QUERROB','QUERROB.Tree'))
@
will use the first name ('QUERROB') for the replacement column with the sum of the selected columns.


\section{Site data}

\texttt{tv.site} will load the site (header) data and does some basic corrections caused by Turboveg dBase format.

<<site.echo, eval=TRUE>>=
site <- tv.site(db)
@

The function is quite straightforward. After loading the file \emph{tvhabita.dbf} from the specified database folder, warnings are given for plots without specified relev\'{e} area or date and fields are checked if they are empty (a lot of predefined header fields in Turboveg are often unused) or contain probably mistakable 0 values in numerical fields, due to dBase deficiencies (dBase can not handle NA = not available values reliably).
It is stated in the output, if you have to check and possibly correct 0 values.




\section{VegetWeb, the National German vegetation plot repository}

To prevent incompatibilities with Windows users who want to use Turboveg data but do not want to use VegetWeb data or are not able to install R package RMySQL, I excluded the VegetWeb functions from package vegdata. They can still be downloaded from the following website

<<VegetWeb, eval=FALSE>>=
source('http://geobot.botanik.uni-greifswald.de/download/r_package/vegetweb.r')
@

\section{ESVeg, a XML exchange format for vegetation data}
\label{ESVeg}

First preliminary functions to load vegetation data from ESVeg formatted XML files are now implemented. As soon as there is a software to use Veg-X, the international TDWG exchange standard for vegetation data, I will implement functions for this.

<<ESVeg>>=
download.file('http://geobot.botanik.uni-greifswald.de/download/data/T302.xml', "T302.xml")
T302.site <- ESveg.site('T302.xml')
T302.site <- T302.site[!is.na(T302.site$LONGITUDE),]
@


\section{Additional functions}

Use help(package='vegdata') for a complete list of available functions and data sets in vegdata.

\subsection{Combine different taxonomic reference lists}

If you have to combine different taxonomic reference lists, functions \texttt{tv.compRefl} might be a starting point, comparing species numbers and/or species names of both lists.
<<eval=FALSE>>=
tv.compRefl('taxref1', 'taxref2')
@

\subsection{Frequency tables}

\texttt{syntab} produces a relative or absolute frequency table of a classified vegetation table with the possibility to filter according to threshold values. To exemplify the function we use the second dataset implemented in the package. It is the demonstration dataset from \cite{Leyer2007}, a selection of grassland relev\'{e}s from the floodplains of the river Elbe.

<<elbaue, results=hide>>=
elbaue <- tv.veg('elbaue')
elbaue.env <- tv.site('elbaue')
@

<<cluster>>=
clust <- vector('integer', nrow(elbaue.env))
clust[elbaue.env$MGL < -50 & elbaue.env$SDGL < 50] <- 1		# dry sites, low deviation
clust[elbaue.env$MGL < -50 & elbaue.env$SDGL >= 50] <- 2	# dry sites, high deviation
clust[elbaue.env$MGL >= -50 & elbaue.env$SDGL >= 50] <- 3	# wet sites, high deviation
clust[elbaue.env$MGL >= -50 & elbaue.env$SDGL < 50] <- 4	# wet sites, low deviation
levels(clust) <- c('dry.ld','dry.hd', 'wet.hd','wet.ld')
@

We can e.g. look at the relative frequency of all species with more than 40\% at least in one column, according to the height of the groundwater table (low or high) and the amplitude of the groundwater table fluctuations (high or low deviations from the mean).
Additionally we can use the affiliation of species to abiotic clusters with the help of package \texttt{indicspecies}, which calculates species indicator values for one or several cluster \citep{DeCaceres2010} to order the syntaxonical table. 

<<syntab.mupa>>=
syntab(elbaue, clust, mupa=TRUE, fullnames=TRUE)
@






\section{Vegetation analyses}

The package \emph{vegdata} serves mostly as a helper for the analysis of vegetation data. Several powerful R packages like \emph{vegan} and others exist, to provide a very broad range of possibilities.


\subsection{Plot coordinates of vegetation relev\'{e}s into an interactive Google Map}

We will use data from VegetWeb (Schmitt, Fartmann, Hoelzel 2010 Phytosociology and ecology of \emph{Gladiolus palustris} in southern Bavaria, Tuexenia 30, p. 105-128.) to make an interactive map of plot locations. The data has already been loaded through the ESVeg functionality \ref{ESVeg}.


A database with \Sexpr{nrow(T302.site)} plots with plot locations.

If you do not have geodesic coordinates as used in Google Earth (EPSG-Code 4326), you could convert coordinates with R packages rgdal.

<<eval=FALSE>>=
library(rgdal)
library(googleVis)
coord <- data.frame(lat=T302.site$LATITUDE, long=T302.site$LONGITUDE)
coordinates(coord) <- c("long", "lat")
proj4string(coord) <- CRSargs(CRS("+init=epsg:31468")) # GK, 4. Stripe
coord <- spTransform(coord, CRS("+init=epsg:4326")) # WGS 84, geographical coordinates, decimal degrees
T302.site$long <- coordinates(coord)[,1]
T302.site$lat <- coordinates(coord)[,2]
@

To give some information in the interactive map, we will Provide Hyperlink Tips:
<<eval=FALSE>>=
T302.site$loc <- paste(T302.site$LATITUDE, T302.site$LONGITUDE, sep=':')
T302.site$tip <- paste(paste('Releve_NR:', T302.site$plotCode), paste('Table:', T302.site$referenceTable), paste('Nr. in table:', T302.site$referencePlot), paste('Date:', T302.site$obsEndDate), paste('Landuse:', T302.site$NUTZUNG), paste('Author:', T302.site$ERHEBER), paste('Locality:', T302.site$LOKALIT__T), paste('Longitude:', T302.site$LONGITUDE), paste('Latitude:', T302.site$LATITUDE), paste('geogr. Uncertaintity:', T302.site$GENAUIGKEI), sep='<BR>')
@
and the produced map will open in your web browser.

<<eval=FALSE, fig=FALSE>>=
places <- gvisMap(T302.site[,c('loc','tip')], 'loc', 'tip', options=list(showTip=TRUE, showLine=FALSE, enableScrollWheel=TRUE, mapType='hybrid', useMapTypeControl=TRUE, width=1000, height=800))
plot(places)

\subsection{Multivariate Ordinations}

With the functions shown above we are now ready to do some example analyses in the wide area of vegetation analyses.

We can do, for instance, a
``Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling with Stable Solution from Random Starts Axis Scaling and Species Scores''
which is a wrapper for Kruskal's Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling \citep{Cox19942001} from Jari Oksanen \citep{Oksanen2008}.

<<nmds, quiet=TRUE, results=hide, eval=TRUE>>=
## Data analyses
library(vegan)
veg.nmds <- metaMDS(elbaue, distance = "bray", trymax = 5, autotransform =FALSE, noshare = 1, expand = TRUE, trace = 2)
mT.F <- meanTraits('OEK_F', elbaue)
mT.N <- meanTraits('OEK_N', elbaue)
env <- envfit(veg.nmds, data.frame(mT.F,mT.N))
@

To show the result in comparison with environmental measurements in a nice graphic we do some plotting magic.

<<nmdsplotfun, quiet=TRUE, results=hide>>=
library(labdsv)
library(akima)
color = function(x)rev(topo.colors(x))
nmds.plot <- function(ordi, site, var1, var2, disp, plottitle =  'NMDS', env = NULL, ...) {
 lplot <- nrow(ordi$points);  lspc <- nrow(ordi$species)
 filled.contour(interp(ordi$points[, 1], ordi$points[, 2], site[, var1]), 
                ylim = c(-1, 1.1), xlim = c(-1.4, 1.4),
   color.palette = color, xlab = var1, ylab = var2, main = plottitle,
    key.title = title(main = var1, cex.main = 0.8, line = 1, xpd = NA),
    plot.axes = { axis(1);  axis(2)
      points(ordi$points[, 1], ordi$points[, 2], xlab = "", ylab = "", cex= .5, col = 2, pch = '+')
      points(ordi$species[, 1], ordi$species[, 2], xlab = "", ylab = "", cex=.2, pch = 19)
      ordisurf(ordi, site[, var2], col = 'black', choices = c(1, 2), add = TRUE)
      orditorp(ordi, display = disp, pch = " ")
      legend("topright", paste("GAM of ", var2), col = 'black', lty = 1)
      if(!is.null(env)) plot(env, col='red')
   }
  ,...)
}

The first axis of our NMDS plot show the influence of mean groundwater level on the patterns of the dataset. \emph{Glyceria maxima} is marking the wet side of the gradient, whereas \emph{Cnidium dubium} \emph{Agrostis capillaris} or \emph{Galium verum agg,} occur only at low mean groundwater level. The second axis can be assigned to the fluctuation of water levels measured as standard deviation of mean groundwater level. Species indicating high water fluctuation are \emph{Agrostis stolonifera} or \emph{Alopecurus geniculatus} whereas \emph{Carex vesicaria} occurs only at more balanced situations.
